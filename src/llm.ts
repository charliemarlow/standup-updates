  Ignore any items with (ignore) tag. Do not include any lines about catching up
  on Slack or posting an update.

  Guidelines:
  â€¢ If there are no last logs, omit that section.
  â€¢ Use Linear numbers for referencing tasks, but also a short summary based on the title.
  â€¢ Make it sound like a human software engineer wrote it.
  â€¢ Wrap the PR references and Linear references in Slack links.
  â€¢ Always list all of the completed code reviews and their count.
  â€¢ If there are no code reviews, omit that section.
  â€¢ Don't include an emoji at the end unless the user requests it.
  â€¢ Follow any instructions on a line after LLM. That's a message for you, obey it.
    â€¢ Append reminders at the end, otherwise omit that section.
